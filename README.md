# Text-Extraction
In this project i tried to extract important part of the sentence just like if the sentence is "Remind me to book bus ticket" then extracted part should be "book bus ticket"

Main_script.ipynb -> main driver code
training_data.csv -> training data for model
result.csv -> it contains result
regex_matcher.py -> it contains regex model to extract part of sentance
evalution_data.txt -> test data for models
output.txt -> result from regex model of test data
classifier.pickle -> helper file for classifier model
vectoriser.pickle -> helper file for vectorizing words
